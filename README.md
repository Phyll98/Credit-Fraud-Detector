# Credit-Fraud-Detector
Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy and efficiency. Leveraged advanced data preprocessing, balancing techniques (SMOTE and Random Under-Sampling), and feature engineering to address the significant class imbalance in the dataset (99.83% non-fraudulent vs. 0.17% fraudulent transactions). Key achievements include:

- Designed and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors), achieving an AUC-ROC score of 0.97 with Logistic Regression.
- Enhanced model recall and F1-scores by integrating oversampling techniques like SMOTE, making the solution more robust to fraudulent cases.
- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, PCA) for better feature analysis and visualization.
- Utilized Neural Networks for experimentation, highlighting the potential of deep learning in fraud detection.
- Emphasized precision-recall trade-offs to optimize for minimal false negatives in detecting fraud.
